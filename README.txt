A little app that allows you to memorise long sentences. Designed to be used in the context of memorising Bible verses.

Verses are read in from the reference.txt file and processed in the app. Guess the first letter of each word, and every number.
To add a new verse, copy in this line and change the prompt and verse:
00000	0000	Prompt	Verse
I have added a few verses to begin with, I hope you enjoy!
